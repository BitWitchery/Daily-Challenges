Simulating Chemical Reactions in the Lab

Create a function named simulate_reaction that receives elements and quantities as its parameters.

You are a curious scientist exploring chemical reactions in a brightly lit laboratory. 
Your task is to simulate a simple chemical reaction experiment using the given elements and their quantities.

The function should perform the following operations in order:

    1. Combine the first two elements in the list if their quantities allow it. 
       This means adding their quantities and keeping only the first element's name.
    2. Double the quantity of the third element (if it exists).
    3. Reverse the order of the remaining elements and their quantities.
    4. Remove any elements with zero quantity.

After performing these operations, create a new list where each element is represented as a string in the format "ElementQuantity" (e.g., "H2", "O1", "C3").

Parameters:

    - elements (list of str): A list of strings representing chemical elements (e.g., ["H", "O", "C", "N"]).
    - quantities (list of int): A list of integers representing the quantity of each element (e.g., [2, 1, 3, 1]).

The function returns a list of strings representing the final state of the elements after the reaction.
